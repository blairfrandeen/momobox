# The Momo Box
An open-source clone of the [Toniebox](https://us.tonies.com/pages/toniebox). This is a toy I'm building for my daughter (Momo). It consists of an MP3 player, a speaker, an RFID sensor, and 3D printed figurines. Each figurine has a unique song or story associated with it. When the figurines are placed on top of the box, the song or story will play.

For example, when this wild gentleman is placed on top of the box, Momo will be serenaded with [Where the Wild Things Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYODJWX3M0k):
